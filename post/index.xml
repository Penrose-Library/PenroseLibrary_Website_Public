      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent Go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website.</description>

Save it somewhere specific as we will be using it in the next step.
More complete instructions are available at Install Hugo
Step 2. Build the Docs Hugo has its own example site which happens to also be the documentation site you are reading right now.</description>

      <description>Research and post by Bill Huntington, Whitman College and Northwest Archives
On the occasion of Kathleen Murray’s upcoming installation as the 14th president of Whitman College, it’s a good time to take a look back at inaugurations past.
Alexander J. Anderson, Whitman’s first president (1882-1891), apparently had no public celebration at the beginning of his term, which was also the birth of the college proper, although Whitman Seminary had existed (at least on paper) since 1859.</description>

      <description>This is a brief list of anti-racist books, focused on books we have digital access to while the library is closed. We also want to make a particular point to call out the years of work done by Whitman students through their theses to explore and contend with police brutality, anti-blackness, and race through a variety of prisms and disciplines.</description>

      <description>Banned Books Week, an annual event sponsored by a coalition of libraries, publishers, booksellers, teachers, and journalists, emphasizes the importance of the freedom to express and share ideas. In 2016, it takes place from September 25 to October 1.
This year, the Penrose Library display for Banned Book Week focuses on one particular example of restricting access to information: the attempt by the Chicago Public Schools (CPS) in 2013 to remove Marjane Satrapi’s autobiographical graphic novel depicting her childhood in post-revolutionary Iran, Persepolis, from the school district’s curricula and school libraries.</description>

These complaints were the basis for book challenges in libraries and schools in the United States. Banned Books Week draws national attention to attempts to remove or restrict books and the harms of censorship.</description>

Games are an important part of cultural heritage, and have served in that role for millennia. Indeed, they are as important as literature, art, and music, but rarely do we think of them as raw material for study and analysis.
We are in the midst of a golden age of board games.</description>

      <description>May 1-7 marks Choose Privacy Week annually, but this year it might feel more pressing than in years past, though the privacy issues are not new. The week was started by the American Library Association (ALA). As spaces devoted to providing access to information, libraries have been concerned with privacy since becoming a part of public life in the 19th century, committed to protecting what our patrons access and providing vetted information on privacy to our patrons.</description>

U.S. Senator from Wisconsin Gaylord Nelson had begun to organize a nationwide teach-in and day for environmental action the previous September. Although there was an organizational infrastructure, events were not planned centrally, so each of the over 12,000 events nationwide owed its existence to local planners and participants.</description>

      <description>The Whitman College class of 1917 is not as well-documented as many others; after 1916, there was a hiatus in the production of Waiilatpu, the Whitman College yearbook, that lasted until 1921. However, a member of the class of 1917 wrote a poem about commencement that appeared in the 1916 Waiilatpu, shown below.</description>

      <description>Looking back 100 years or so, how did Americans celebrate Halloween? Trick-or-treating was not established, although pranks certainly were; decorating with jack-o-lanterns was popular, and costumes were much in demand. Both children and adults tended to celebrate with parties or masquerades.
One set of customs seems to have died out: communicating with the spirits in order to see the future, most commonly expressed as who you would marry.</description>

It’s worth noting, though, that in fact some women in the United States had the right to vote before the 19th amendment to the Constitution became federal law on August 26, 1920.</description>

      <description>In collaboration with students in Library 160: Documentation and Representation in Archives, the Whitman College and Northwest Archives is creating a digital archive of the Whitman community&#39;s experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. As we move classes online, work, teach and learn from home, and practice social distancing, our normal experiences and routines have been displaced and disrupted.</description>

      <description>Last year for Open Access Week, we profiled a few Whitman professors who are writing and using Open Educational Resources in their classes. This year we’re talking with professors who have published works of scholarship in Open Access journals. We asked them about their reasons for choosing an open access journal and their experiences of the publishing process, as well as what they see as the larger significance of open access publishing.</description>

      <description>The 20th Annual Whitman Undergraduate Conference will take place on April 10, 2018. Penrose Library and the Whitman College and Northwest Archives want to help students share their Undergraduate Conference research with the Whitman Community and beyond!
Sharing your research in ARMINDA, Whitman&amp;rsquo;s institutional repository, means that you have a link to your work that you can potentially provide to employers or graduate schools.</description>
