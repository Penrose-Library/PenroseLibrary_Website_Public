/*

 Java Script Calendar is a small script for web pages which displays current 
 Day of the week, Month, Date and Year along with Holidays notification. Just 
 like this working demo below. It will work with Netscape 2++, Microsoft 3++ 
 and Opera 3++ web browsers.
 
 Tuesday, November 24, 1998  
  About 70 holidays from all over the world are displayed by Calendar (if you 
 know other ones, let me know, I will add them). It even calculates Easter 
 Sunday date! To see how it works change the date on your computer to January, 
 1, for example and re-load the page.
 
 Installation is very simple. Just copy the script below, everything between 
 SCRIPT and SCRIPT tags (including tags themselves) and paste in the place 
 you want it to appear on your page. You can customize the way it looks by 
 changing text =  function arguments just after month names definitions. 
 Java Script Calendar is free without any limitations. Copyright Â© Eugene 
 Vassiltsov. But please, let me know if you will use it.

 Changed if's to if - else if's and combined dates into months so we don't have
 to do all of the checks on each page load.  BWM 07.13.05
